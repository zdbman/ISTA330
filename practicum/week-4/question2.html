        1. Display the flowers as per question 1.<br />
        2. Add the following functionality to the page:<br />
        When users click on an image, the images should be
        reorganized using the following rule:<br />
        The flower that has been clicked goes to the first position in
        the first row. The next position in the first row will
        be the flower whose name is alphabeticlly right after the
        name of the first one and so on for the other flowers.
        <br />
        So, for example if a user clicks on the flower lily,
        then the flowers should be rearranged as:
        <br />
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    lily
                </td>
                <td>
                    rose
                </td>
                <td>
                    sunflower
                </td>
                <td>
                    tulip
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    water lily
                </td>
                <td>
                    cherry blossom
                </td>
                <td>
                    daffodil
                </td>
                <td>
